# INTEGRATE DELETE API =>

    i. Make a component for delete user.
    ii. Why need delete component.
    iii. Call delete api method.
    iv. Test api with ui.


    If we are create a delete button on server component, then it will not work bcz we need to use event and event don't work on server component. So we can create a different component and import that on that file.
